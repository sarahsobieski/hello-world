Just another repository

Hi There - my name is Sarah Sobieski and I am coding away here on this GitHub site.  I am a healthcare entrepreneur, financial services executive and the founder of a non-profit dedicated to getting kids excited about science, technology, engineering and math.  I'm working on opening a private, 501c3 STEM academy in Chicago.  To begin with we will be focused on infants through pre-k with an emphasis on integrating STEM principles into the cirriculum, including coding.  Can't wait to begin spreading the news once we find our physical location.  www.chicagostemacademy.org is the official site.  Visit us there and subscribe to the newsletter to learn more...
